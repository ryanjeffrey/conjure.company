        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>
          This project was built out of curiosity for the new wave of tech that
          everyone is talking about- Artificial Intelligence. Sounds scary,
          right? In fact, machine learning tools such as ChatGPT are useful in
          many ways. The GPT-3 model that this program employs can be used to
          generate high-quality text for copywriting tasks, including product
          descriptions, marketing materials, and headlines. It can also
          summarize long texts by extracting the most important information,
          presenting it in a clear and concise manner. This model can also be
          used to translate text into other languages and so much more. Think of
          it like Google but way more impressive ðŸ¤¯.
          <br />
          <br />
          This project was built using the Next.js framework which makes it fast
          and easy to use. I used TypeScript and React for the front end and
          TailwindCSS to optimize the styling. User data is stored securely on a
          Firebase backend which is accessed by Google OAuth - allowing users to
          sign in with their gmail accounts instead of creating a new account.
          Due to the data persistence layer, users can return to previous AI
          chats every time they access the app. Try it out and remember - the more specific the prompt, the better the answer will be.
